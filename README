Overview
---------
A vector is implemented as a vector of nodes containing vectors of nodes
and so on to the leaf level where we have vectors of u64 used as bit vecs

To Do
------
- Add std::ops operator overloading for [], &, |, etc.
- Add trait method to find size of the box in bytes
- Create macro as: bitfoovec![5, 98000, 42] to create
  a vector with the given bits set
- Add conveniences to convert container bits to json, string, debug info
